Broadcast behaviour: W followed by R; check for W of different sizes, followed by R of always equal (e.g., MSG/ACK)
Ping-type: R chain; in sequence, all of same size; read-only behaviour, all positive (actual reads, not polling); chain must all be same size... so if the reads are contiguous, then they MUST all have the same size

This is because we assume that the read behaviour should be stateless, unless influenced by some other input/output behaviour

Decide on type:
  - Server like: did we see accept?
Otherwise:
  - Broadcast-type: W-R (message/ack)
  - Notify-type: R (M/M chain)
